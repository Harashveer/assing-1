            Pro professional, pure persistent, I'm paper chasing I hate
            complaining, I hated waiting, I'll pay for patience But I hate to
            pay a bill (Hate that)
          </p>
          <p>
            And I made a mil' without a major deal (I made that) Yeah, her ass
            fake, but she came for real (She came, uh) Money ain't a thing, that
            ain't a thing for real It's the broke lingo (Huh)

            When the pain leaves (Huh) Where does the pain go? (Where?) Tip of
            the backwood is where the flame goes (There) To the sky is where my
            brain goes (Wow)
          </p>
          <p>
            Same pack, same fiend, sellin' the same clothes (Wow) Pinocchio and
            my pistol, they got the same nose Me and my niggas gotta eat, we
            share the same stove (What?) Case closed, bodies in my lane, bitch,
            lane closed

          <h3>Verse 2</h3>
        </div>
        <div>
          <p>
            Game over, Thanos on you H-O's On my <span class="profanity">petty shit</span> but I don't paint
            toes (Yeah) Get the plunger (Plunger) 'cause Marshall and M.A go
            plum crazy Call us liquid plumber, 'cause even Dre know (Dre know)
            Beat knocks like a beefed up Detox
          </p>
          <p>
            You're gonna need three squads of police officers at least to come
            pull me off of it and I don't stop
          </p>
          <p>
            Please, dawg, I need y'all to keep talking shit 'cause I feed off of
            it I am the complete opposite of these retards who spit these weak
            bars, I'ma leave carnage
          </p>
          <p>
            Each thought'll be so toxic, it'll block the wind through your
            esophagus Stop it, cutting off your oxygen
          </p>
          <p>
            And I hit them pads like a boxing gym Better watch for Slim, better
            get to popping and when I'm at the top again I won't topple, I'm
            giving it to anyone who wanna come and get it and I'm not gonna stop
          </p>
          <p>
            But when they ask me is the war finished with MGK? Of course it is I
            cleansed him of his mortal sins, I'm God and the Lord forgives even
            the devil worshippers I'm moving on but you know your scruples are
            gone when you're born with Lucifer's horns
          </p>
          <p>
            And you're from the school of Notorious, Puba, Cube and The Poor
            Righteous Teachers tutored my students Showed them all the blueprint
            and formula
          </p>
          <p>
            But it seems like the more they studied my music, the more they
            remind me of eyeballs I'm watching my pupils get cornier (Uh)
          </p>
          <p>
            But I'm contemplating yelling "Bombs away" on the game Like I'm
            outside of an Ariana Grande concert waiting

        </div>
        <div>
          <p>
            Man, I don't see why they hate me (Huh?) I'm a clown like John Wayne
            Gacy (What?) They call me Kanye crazy (Yah) APESHIT, Beyonce, Jay-Z
            (Woo) And I'm back with Andre, baby (Yeah) And the doctor's
            operating (What?) But he never put no scrubs on from Snoop, K. Dot
            to Shady
          </p>
          <p>
            Shady like a shadow or your silhouette, intellect, I better check to
            see why you feel upset
          </p>
          <p>
            'Cause I met your bitch on the internet now I'm getting head like a
            Pillow Pet That bimbo can put her lips all the way around this bone
            and then blow Like a dusty cartridge from an old Nintendo Those were
            the days but I bet you, I'm never gonna be broke again, no
          </p>
          <p>I don't smoke but I got paper, to be blunt, I'm rolling Indo</p>
          <p>
            And I keep it one comma, zero, zero, zero, zero Real, real, real,
            murder, murder, murder, kill, kill, kill
          </p>
          <p>
            Nickel-plated, twenty two, two, two <span class="profanity">Bitch</span>, shut the <span class="profanity">fuck </span>up 'fore I
            shoot you too Ain't <span class="profanity">shit</span> I won't do just to get a few YouTube views
            Run up in a church like pew, pew, pew 'Cause that's what I do, do,
            do
          </p>
          <p>
            But, even to the untrained human eye We ain't the same, you and I
            Somebody should have explained to you why For you to go against me,
            it's simply insane, you will die (Yeah)
          </p>
          <p>
            That's why they call me Kamikaze, it's plain suicide, yeah But I
            know magic and here go my last trick I'm 'bout to say "Abracadabra"
            and pull a B Rabbit up out of my hat I'm about to relapse and I
            betcha that you won't know how to react But a look of disgust, I
            don't doubt it'd be that
          </p>
          <p>
            As I begin to <span class="profanity">fuckin'</span> devour the track And you backpedal, that is a
            cowardly act Like a Saudi attack when the towers collapsed
          </p>
